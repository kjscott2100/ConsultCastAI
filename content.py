"""
ConsultCastAI persona and scenario content model.

Six SMB owner personas across different industries, each skeptical of AI
adoption for a different reason (cost, trust, data risk, staff adoption,
job displacement, "I already tried ChatGPT"). This is the practice surface
an AI consultant rehearses against before a real discovery or sales call.

In production this moves to Firestore/Postgres behind an admin screen. Here
it's a plain dict so the rest of the app is written against the real shape
and can be repointed later without touching coaching.py, prompts.py, or
main.py.
